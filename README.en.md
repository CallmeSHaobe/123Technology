They will be considered adding requested features where possible. UwU

Some features are inspired by Twist Space Technology Mod, etc.

Remember to update the GregTech language files, otherwise machine tooltips may display incorrectly in English.

Regarding the **large explosion** of TecTech-style machines added by 123Technology:

(Yes, I re-added the explosion effect when TecTech-style machines are destroyed.)

(This applies only to machines added by 123Technology.)

You can disable this in the config file.

### To avoid the bugs caused by the Mod names. Please note the following -w-.

1.The mod file name MUST be kept as OTHTechnology.

(Note: The file has been renamed to OTHTechnology in the releases for clarity.)

so DO NOT RENAME IT please.

2.If you encounter bugs after renaming the Mod file, DO NOT REPORT THEM thanks, as they are caused by the modification.

3.The ModID is still 123Technology.
